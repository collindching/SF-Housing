# San Francisco Housing Project

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this project, I explored Zillow data in R to identify the best areas for renting and buying homes in San Francisco.

Based on this data, I found that up-and-coming neighborhoods like Bayview and Visitacion Valley were the best rental property investments, while affluent neighborhoods like Presidio Heights gave renters the best bang for their buck.
