Visualizing San Francisco's Housing Market with Zillow Data

Final recommendations: would I be willing to put my money where my mouth is?

Trying to look for key insights for prospective homeowners and renters in San Francisco. Ultimately, want to make a decision about when and where to rent. 

Questions:
• How has San Francisco gotten more expensive over time?
• What neighborhoods are there with higher potential value?
• What is a good neighborhood for someone like me?
	- Want up-and-coming, hip with accessibility to lots of restaurants

Hypotheses:
• San Francisco


Data requirements:

• neighborhood maps
	- boxplots to show median cost (get high level overview of housing market) by neighborhood
	- then boxplots to show median cost by district

• neighborhood price change over time
	- geographic and boxplots
	- and also percentage change with box plots

• where to buy or when to buy?
	- effect of seasonality on home purchasing
	- appears to be little variation from 
	
• where to rent?
	- effect of seasonality on renting (cheap apartments in winter, most choices in summer)

housing economics


Questions I'm curious about:
how could businesses fit in?

Proposal: 

If I were to find my own place in San Francisco on a new grad salary, could I find a place to live comfortably? I would like to pull data from various sources to analyze areas with the optimal combination cost, safety, and convenience for people in their 20s and 30s.

Would this be useful to me? Yes.
	Perhaps I might find something interesting out about San Francisco housing.
	Or I could at least learn about the different districts.


Questions to answer:

Where are people living?
Where are people moving.
Where would I want to live?
Where would a young family want to live?


Another possibility:

Track the changes in businesses in the area. 

Mapping gentrification: follow how gentrification has changed home prices, businesses, etc.

Fundamental question: is gentrification good or bad?
